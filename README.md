# R course for Hubrect personnel

In this repository, we share all the material generated for the R course performed in the Hubrecht Institute by M. Weherens and A. Alemany. The organization is as follows:

## presentations
Power point presentations, organized in session of ~1-2 hours. In each presentation we sketch the main points that should be learned in the session in order to be able to solve the exercises. 

## list-of-exercises
PDF files with list of exercises to be solved in each session. 

## solution-to-exercises
R scripts containing the solutions for the exercises from each lesson. We want to emphasize that there are many possible solutions, but we only show 1 example. If your code works and produces the same output, then that means your solutions is good.
